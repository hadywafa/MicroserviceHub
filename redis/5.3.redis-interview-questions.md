# 🧠 **Redis Best Practices & Interview Q\&A for Senior .NET Developers**

_🎓 Master Redis patterns, avoid costly mistakes, and confidently answer interview questions like a pro._

## ✅ Best Practices in Redis for .NET Developers

### 1️⃣ **Use `StackExchange.Redis` — Not Basic Clients**

- 🧰 It’s the **official**, battle-tested Redis client for .NET.
- Supports **connection pooling**, **async**, **cluster-aware routing**, and **resilience**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Reuse Connections Properly**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConnectionMultiplexer>(
    ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost:6379"));
```

- ❌ Don’t create new `ConnectionMultiplexer` for each request.
- ✅ Register as singleton to reuse and optimize sockets.

---

### 3️⃣ **Always Set Expirations (TTL)**

```csharp
await _cache.SetStringAsync("user:1:data", "json", new DistributedCacheEntryOptions
{
    AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)
});
```

- ❌ Don’t cache forever unless you want stale/memory-bloating data.
- ✅ Use `SlidingExpiration` for activity-based data, `AbsoluteExpiration` otherwise.

---

### 4️⃣ **Use Meaningful Key Names (Namespacing)**

| Poor Key | Good Key             |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| `12345`  | `user:12345:profile` |
| `cart1`  | `user:12345:cart`    |

Structure: `feature:entity:id`
Helps with readability and grouping during key inspection.

---

### 5️⃣ **Avoid Storing Large Objects**

- 🔥 Redis is an **in-memory** store — avoid bloating with huge JSON payloads.
- ❌ >512MB keys or values → danger zone.
- ✅ Use compressed formats like MessagePack or keep only essential parts.

---

### 6️⃣ **Use Batching / Pipelines for Bulk Operations**

```csharp
var db = _redis.GetDatabase();
var batch = db.CreateBatch();
foreach (var key in keys)
    batch.StringSetAsync(key, "value");

batch.Execute();
```

Avoids multiple round-trips for better performance.

---

### 7️⃣ **Handle Failures Gracefully**

```csharp
try
{
    await _cache.SetStringAsync("key", "value");
}
catch (RedisConnectionException)
{
    // Fallback logic (e.g., write to DB or skip caching)
}
```

- Redis is **external infrastructure** — network failures, outages can happen.
- Always wrap Redis calls in try/catch blocks.

---

### 8️⃣ **Use Redis for What It's Good At**

| Use Case          | Use Redis?   | Notes                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Caching           | ✅ Yes       | Primary use case                          |
| Session storage   | ✅ Yes       | Especially in load-balanced environments  |
| Queueing          | ⚠️ Maybe     | Simple pub/sub okay, but not durable      |
| Durable messaging | ❌ No        | Use RabbitMQ, Kafka for reliable delivery |
| Transactions      | ❌ Not ideal | Use a DB with ACID guarantees             |

## 🎯 Redis Use Patterns in .NET Projects

| Pattern             | Example Use Case                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Cache-Aside         | Manual populate on miss → store in Redis         |
| Read-Through        | Middleware/service auto-fetches from DB & caches |
| Write-Through       | Write to Redis and DB at the same time           |
| Pub/Sub             | Chat systems, real-time events                   |
| Distributed Locking | Mutex with `SET key value NX PX 30000`           |
| Rate Limiting       | Limit API requests per key using counters        |

## ❓ Interview Q\&A for Senior .NET Devs Using Redis

---

### 🔹 Q1: What are common Redis use cases in .NET?

**✅ Answer:**

- Distributed caching for improving performance
- Session state management in ASP.NET Core apps
- Pub/Sub for real-time features (e.g., notifications)
- Temporary storage for rate limiting or throttling

---

### 🔹 Q2: How do you integrate Redis in an ASP.NET Core 8 project?

**✅ Answer:**

- Use `IDistributedCache` for high-level caching
- Use `StackExchange.Redis` for advanced operations
- Configure Redis in `Program.cs` and `appsettings.json`
- Set up singleton `ConnectionMultiplexer` for reuse

---

### 🔹 Q3: What's the difference between `MemoryCache` and `RedisCache`?

| Feature     | `MemoryCache`                | `RedisCache`                 |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Scope       | Local to app instance        | Shared across instances      |
| Persistence | In-memory only               | Optional AOF/RDB on disk     |
| Use Case    | Simple caching, fast lookup  | Multi-instance, centralized  |
| Scale       | Not suitable for distributed | Perfect for distributed apps |

---

### 🔹 Q4: How do you avoid key collisions in Redis?

**✅ Answer:**

- Use **namespaces or prefixes** (`user:123:cart`)
- Keep consistent key naming across the app
- Avoid raw numeric or GUID-only keys

---

### 🔹 Q5: When should Redis **not** be used?

**✅ Answer:**

- For storing large binary or blob data
- For transactional operations requiring full ACID
- As the primary database — it's volatile and memory-bound

---

### 🔹 Q6: What's the difference between AOF and RDB persistence?

| Feature     | RDB (Snapshot)             | AOF (Append Only File)       |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Frequency   | Periodic                   | Logs every write             |
| Durability  | Lower (loss of recent ops) | Higher                       |
| Performance | Faster                     | Slower write, safer recovery |
| File size   | Smaller                    | Larger                       |

---

### 🔹 Q7: How can you scale Redis?

**✅ Answer:**

- Use **Redis Sentinel** for HA
- Use **Redis Cluster** for sharding
- Use **read replicas** for distributing read traffic
- In cloud: use **Azure Redis Cache** or **AWS ElastiCache**

---

### 🔹 Q8: How would you implement rate limiting using Redis?

**✅ Answer:**
Use atomic `INCR` and `EXPIRE` commands on a key like `rate:userId`.

```csharp
var db = _redis.GetDatabase();
var key = $"rate:{userId}";
var count = db.StringIncrement(key);
if (count == 1)
    db.KeyExpire(key, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
if (count > 100)
    return "Rate limit exceeded!";
```

## 🏁 Final Thoughts for Seniors

- Redis is **not just a cache** — it’s a versatile tool.
- But don’t **abuse it** — know where it fits.
- Always pair Redis with **observability** (monitor hits/misses).
- Use **backoff logic** and circuit breakers in high-traffic apps.
