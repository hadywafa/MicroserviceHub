# 🐳 **Topic 2: Installing RabbitMQ with Docker + Management UI**

> In this hands-on topic, you’ll set up RabbitMQ locally in seconds using Docker — with a full-featured **web dashboard (UI)** to monitor queues, exchanges, messages, and consumers. No need to install anything on your OS!

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites

✅ You need:

- Docker installed ✅
- Terminal or command line access ✅

You don’t need to install RabbitMQ manually — Docker does it all.

---

## 🐇 Step 1: Run RabbitMQ in Docker

This command pulls and runs the **official RabbitMQ image** with the Management Plugin enabled.

```bash
docker run -d --hostname rabbit \
  --name rabbitmq \
  -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 \
  rabbitmq:3-management
```

| Port  | Description                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 5672  | AMQP (for .NET apps)         |
| 15672 | RabbitMQ Web UI (management) |

> 🎉 That’s it! Your RabbitMQ is running in Docker in detached mode (`-d`).

---

## 🖥 Step 2: Access RabbitMQ Web UI

Open your browser and visit:

```ini
http://localhost:15672
```

### 🔑 Default credentials

## 🔍 Web UI Overview

The dashboard gives you full control over RabbitMQ:

| Section            | What It Does                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Connections     | Shows active apps using RabbitMQ     |
| 📦 Queues          | Create/manage message queues         |
| 🔀 Exchanges       | Configure routing and exchange types |
| 📜 Channels        | Streams of messages between apps     |
| 📊 Overview        | Node stats: memory, uptime, messages |
| 🧑‍💻 Users/Vhosts | Configure access control             |

> 💡 You’ll use this UI to **create queues**, test messages manually, and monitor what your .NET app is doing.

---

## 🧹 Step 3: Stopping / Removing RabbitMQ

Stop the container:

```bash
docker stop rabbitmq
```

Remove the container:

```bash
docker rm rabbitmq
```

---

## 🧪 Optional: Run with a Volume (Persistence)

If you want RabbitMQ to **keep messages and settings between restarts**, use a named volume:

```bash
docker run -d --hostname rabbit \
  --name rabbitmq \
  -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 \
  -v rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq \
  rabbitmq:3-management
```
