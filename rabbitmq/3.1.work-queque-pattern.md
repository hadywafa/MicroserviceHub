# 🛠️ **Topic 4: Work Queue Pattern — Distributing Tasks with Multiple Consumers**

> In this topic, we’ll build a producer that pushes **multiple tasks** to a queue, and spin up **multiple consumers** that each take one task at a time — **load-balanced** automatically by RabbitMQ 💪

---

## 📋 What Is the Work Queue Pattern?

- Also called **Task Queue**
- Used to **distribute time-consuming tasks** to multiple workers
- Each consumer (worker) takes **one job at a time**
- RabbitMQ handles the **round-robin dispatching**

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy

> Imagine a **pizza shop** where customers place orders (tasks), and multiple chefs (consumers) take one order at a time from the task board (queue) 🧑‍🍳🍕.

---

## 🧪 What You’ll Build

- **Producer**: Publishes 5 messages (e.g., "Task 1", "Task 2", …)
- **Consumer**: Each one picks **one message**, waits 1–5 sec (simulating work), then ACKs it
- You’ll run **2-3 instances** of the consumer app to observe load balancing

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Update Your Producer (RabbitMQ.Producer)

```csharp
using RabbitMQ.Client;
using System.Text;

var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };

using var connection = factory.CreateConnection();
using var channel = connection.CreateModel();

channel.QueueDeclare("work-queue", durable: true, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false, arguments: null);

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    string message = $"Task {i}";
    var body = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);

    var properties = channel.CreateBasicProperties();
    properties.Persistent = true;

    channel.BasicPublish(exchange: "",
                         routingKey: "work-queue",
                         basicProperties: properties,
                         body: body);

    Console.WriteLine($" [x] Sent: {message}");
}
```

🧠 Notes:

- ✅ Set `durable: true` to keep queue after restart
- ✅ Set `Persistent = true` so messages survive crashes

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Update Your Consumer (RabbitMQ.Consumer)

```csharp
using RabbitMQ.Client;
using RabbitMQ.Client.Events;
using System.Text;

var factory = new ConnectionFactory() { HostName = "localhost" };

using var connection = factory.CreateConnection();
using var channel = connection.CreateModel();

channel.QueueDeclare("work-queue", durable: true, exclusive: false, autoDelete: false, arguments: null);

channel.BasicQos(prefetchSize: 0, prefetchCount: 1, global: false); // Fair dispatch

Console.WriteLine(" [*] Waiting for tasks...");

var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(channel);

consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
{
    var body = ea.Body.ToArray();
    var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(body);

    Console.WriteLine($" [x] Received: {message}");

    int delay = new Random().Next(1, 5);
    Thread.Sleep(delay * 1000);

    Console.WriteLine($" [✓] Done ({delay}s)");

    channel.BasicAck(deliveryTag: ea.DeliveryTag, multiple: false);
};

channel.BasicConsume(queue: "work-queue", autoAck: false, consumer: consumer);

Console.ReadLine();
```

🧠 Notes:

- `BasicQos(0, 1, false)`: ensures **one unacked message per consumer**
- `autoAck: false`: we ACK manually after processing
- `BasicAck()`: tells RabbitMQ "I’m done with this"

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Run Multiple Consumers

Run multiple terminal tabs of:

```bash
dotnet run --project RabbitMQ.Consumer
```

Each one will pull one message at a time. When one finishes, it gets another.

Then run the producer:

```bash
dotnet run --project RabbitMQ.Producer
```

📦 Output example:

```ini
Consumer 1:
 [x] Received: Task 1
 [✓] Done (2s)

Consumer 2:
 [x] Received: Task 2
 [✓] Done (4s)
```

---

## 🔍 What’s Happening?

RabbitMQ is:

- Dispatching tasks one-by-one to idle consumers
- Ensuring **only one unacked task per consumer** (fair dispatch)
- Waiting for `BasicAck` before sending the next

---

## ⚠️ Why Manual ACKs Matter

Without manual ACKs:

- If a consumer crashes mid-task, message is **lost**
- With manual ACK, RabbitMQ **requeues** unacked tasks

✅ This is critical in real-world systems!

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept             | Benefit                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `BasicQos(1)`       | Prevents flooding slow consumers        |
| `autoAck: false`    | Increases reliability                   |
| Manual `BasicAck()` | Ensures task is complete before removal |
| Multiple consumers  | Load-balanced task processing           |
