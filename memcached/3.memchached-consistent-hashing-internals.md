# 🧠 Deep Dive: Memcached Consistent Hashing

If you're managing **session data in Memcached** — especially in a dynamic, auto-scaling environment — you'll hear a lot about **Consistent Hashing**. But what is it really? How does it work internally?

Forget the black box — let's break down consistent hashing in a clear, **visual, step-by-step** way with examples!

---

## 🔄 **What is Consistent Hashing?**

### 🔹 **Definition:**

Consistent Hashing is a **distributed hashing technique** where adding/removing a node **only affects a subset of keys** — making it ideal for session caching.

Imagine you have a **hash ring** — not a line, not a table, but a **circle**. This is the core idea.

---

## 🔁 **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### 🎯 Step 1: Hash the Nodes (Servers)

You start with 3 Memcached nodes:

- `Node A`
- `Node B`
- `Node C`

Each node is hashed using a consistent hash function (`hash(node_id)`) to place it on a **circular ring** of values from `0` to `2^32 - 1`.

Let’s say the positions end up like this:

```text
Ring (0 to 2^32):
 ┌──────────────┐
 │              │
 │    Node B    │
 │              │
 │              │
Node C      Node A
```

Node hashes:

- `hash(Node A)` → 70
- `hash(Node B)` → 20
- `hash(Node C)` → 50

> 📎 The hash ring is logical. It’s a sorted list of node positions from 0 → 2^32-1 → back to 0.

---

### 🧩 Step 2: Hash the Session Key

A session comes in, say: `session_ABC`.

- Hash it: `hash(session_ABC)` → 45
- Find the **first node clockwise** whose position is **≥ 45**

In our ring:

- Node B → 20 (too early)
- Node C → 50 ✅

→ So `session_ABC` is routed to **Node C**.

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Adding a New Node

You scale up! Add `Node D`, whose hash is:

- `hash(Node D)` → 40

Ring now:

```text
        20 (B)
   40 (D)
       50 (C)
          70 (A)
```

🧠 Now `hash(session_ABC)` = 45 still maps to **Node C** (unchanged)

But a session `session_BEE` with hash 38 that **previously mapped to C** now maps to **Node D**.

🎉 **Only a small slice of sessions are remapped!** That’s the magic of consistent hashing.

---

### 🧠 Step 4: Using Virtual Nodes

To improve balance and avoid hash hotspots, each physical node is **hashed multiple times** and placed at multiple points on the ring.

Example:

- `Node A` → hash A1 = 10, A2 = 75, A3 = 300
- `Node B` → hash B1 = 50, B2 = 150, B3 = 290

Now instead of 3 points on the ring, you have 9–15. This ensures **even distribution** of keys and avoids cases where one node handles most of the load.

## 📸 Diagram: Visualizing the Hash Ring

```plaintext
       0
    ┌───────┐
300 │       │ 75
    │       │
    │       │
290 │       │ 150
    └───────┘
       0 → 2^32-1
```

Each session's hash value finds the **next clockwise virtual node**.

---

## 🔄 **When Scaling Happens (Auto Discovery)**

When AWS ElastiCache **adds or removes nodes**, your client:

- Gets the updated node list from ElastiCache.
- Applies consistent hashing with virtual nodes.
- Remaps **only the affected session keys**.

This keeps session cache **resilient**, even during scaling events!

---

## 🤔 **Who runs the consistent hashing logic?**

Yes — you're correct:

> 🔧 **The client (your backend app)** is 100% responsible for:

- **Hashing the session key**
- **Mapping it to a Memcached node**
- **Routing the request to that node**
- **Reading/writing the session**

🧠 Memcached itself is **dumb** — it doesn't know or care about clustering. It just stores and returns keys.

---

## 🧩 So then, **why do we need AWS Auto Discovery**?

You're thinking:

> “If my client already knows the hash ring and where sessions go… why care about Auto Discovery?”

Great question. Here’s why ⤵️

### 🛰️ **Auto Discovery solves this dynamic problem:**

When you use **ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Scaling**, nodes can be **added or removed at any time**.  
You need a way to **automatically detect those changes** and **rebuild your hash ring** in the client.

Without Auto Discovery:

- You’d have to **manually fetch the new IPs**
- Update your node list
- Rebuild the ring logic manually

With Auto Discovery:

- 🔁 Your client asks the **ElastiCache configuration endpoint**:

  ```ini
  "Hey, what's the current node list?"
  ```

- 🧠 Then the **client library updates the ring itself**.

## ✅ **Summary: Why Consistent Hashing Rocks**

| Feature                    | Modulo Hashing ❌  | Consistent Hashing ✅           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Handles node add/remove    | ❌ Remaps all keys | ✅ Remaps only affected keys    |
| Works with auto-scaling    | ❌ Breaks sessions | ✅ Preserves most sessions      |
| Load distribution          | ❌ Can be uneven   | ✅ Balanced with virtual nodes  |
| AWS ElastiCache Compatible | ❌ Not recommended | ✅ Built-in with Auto Discovery |

## 🧠 Final Thought

Consistent Hashing is not a black box:

- It's just **clever math applied to a ring structure**.
- It ensures **scalability, reliability, and performance**.
- It’s **crucial for session caching**, CDNs, distributed databases, and more.

> 🧩 Consistent Hashing is just **an algorithm**, not a service.  
> 🛰️ AWS Auto Discovery is a **mechanism to keep your algorithm up-to-date**.
